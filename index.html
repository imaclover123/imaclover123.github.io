<h3>Canada is changing</h3>
      <p>Just like the rest of the world Canada has been experiencing the effects of climate change. according to the government of Canada We are seeing more intense natural disasters such as floods and wildfires. the Canadian government stated that the risk of climate change is not only environmental risk but also and economic risks. the effect of climate change can affect infrastructure Supply chains and communities. Canada has pledged to take action to combat the effect of climate change.</p>
<p>According to The Canadian climate Institution, Canada is experiencing one of the most hottest years in its history. Canada's heat problem is reaching levels that is affecting the quality of life. This extreme heat is now taken a toll on the Canadian health system. The Canadian climate institution states that within the next 30 Years the cost of heat related deaths and quality of life changes would cost the Canadian people anywhere between 3 and 3.5 billion dollars annually.
</p>
<p>Canada's climate is ever-changing and it's more apparent than ever.  In recent years there have been more and more Forest fires.  In an interview between CTV and the federal government it is said that hotter temperatures would lead to a longer forest fire season.It is also said that Canada is currently experiencing its worst wildfire season of the 21st century and the amount of wildfires are projected to double by 2050.</p>
<h3>Why is canada changing </h3>
<p>Just like every other country that is affected by global warming, Canada's climate has started to change. Climate change is primarily caused due to an increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These greenhouse gas emissions are results of human activities such as the use of fossil fuels, agriculture and other industries.The increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has an effect on the environment, human health and economy.
Canada has sets the year of 2005 as the benchmark of improvement. meaning that the goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below the greenhouse gas emissions of 2005.  Canada has now pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 45% below 2005 by the year 2030.

<p><cite>Greenhouse gas emissions by economic sector, Canada, 1990 to 2021.</cite> Goverment of Canada.</p>
<p>Looking at the data provided by the government of Canada it is clear that the biggest producer of greenhouse gas is the burning of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels is a core part in transportation, oil and gas and creating electricity. 

The increase of greenhouse gas emissions is primarily due to transportation and oil and gas. however this effect is offset by the decrease carbon emission from electricity. As the transportation sector becomes more Electric Canada can reduce its Carbon emissions significantly.
